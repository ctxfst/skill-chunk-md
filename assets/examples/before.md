# My Professional Profile

## About Me

I'm a backend engineer with 8 years of experience building distributed systems. I focus on performance optimization and system reliability.

## Skills

### Python

I use Python daily for building data pipelines and REST APIs. My preferred frameworks are FastAPI for APIs and Pandas for data processing.

Key areas of expertise:
- Async programming with asyncio
- Performance profiling and optimization
- Testing with pytest

### Go

I started using Go 3 years ago for microservices. I appreciate its simplicity and excellent concurrency model.

Main use cases:
- High-throughput API gateways
- CLI tools
- gRPC services

## Projects

### Payment Gateway

Built a payment processing system handling 10k transactions per second. Used Python for the business logic layer and Go for the high-performance gateway.
